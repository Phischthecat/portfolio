        Hello, I am Phil. Clean code lover, tech enthusiast and dedicated
        handball player. During my intensive training as a front-end developer,
        I deepened my knowledge in these technologies and specialized in web app
        development. In the process, I gained a lot of experience and always
        received positive feedback from experienced mentors. I was able to learn
        different technologies in a short period of time and was always looking
        for new challenges to develop myself. I am a very structured and
        analytical thinker and can solve complex tasks quickly and effectively.
        <br />
        <br />
        I have proven this during the training in the various projects in the
        team and independently and also gained significant experience in
        collaboration and project management. Therefore, I am used to taking
        responsibility and working carefully. <br />
        <br />
        I look forward to working on many exciting projects in the future.
      </p>

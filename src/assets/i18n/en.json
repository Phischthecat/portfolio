During my training as a frontend developer, I enjoyed working on various projects in a team as well as independently. In doing so, I gained a lot of experience and was able to put my structured and analytical skills to good use. In projects, I attach great importance to user-friendly interfaces and a good, modern design. As we all know, you eat with your eyes first. I look forward to working on many exciting projects in the future and to developing myself further. Next step: Backend development.": "Hello, I am Phil.
